# Bank-loan-analysis-SQL-Python-Power-Bi-Excel

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Bank Loan data to evaluate loan performance, customer behavior, risk segmentation, and key financial KPIs. Using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, I built a complete data analysis and visualization solution that supports data-driven decision-making for loan approvals, collections, and portfolio health monitoring.

# 🧩 Key Tools & Technologies

**SQL (PostgreSQL)**:  Data extraction, transformation, KPI calculation

**Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Power BI**: Interactive dashboards (Summary, Overview, Details)

**Excel**: Pivot tables, charts, summary dashboards

# Major Project Components

# 1️⃣ SQL Data Analysis

. Created and structured the bank_loan_data table using DDL.

# Performed queries for:

. Total Loan Applications

. Funded Amount

. Amount Received

. Average Interest Rate

. DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)

. Built MTD & PMTD performance metrics

# Calculated:

. Good Loan Percentage

. Bad Loan Percentage

. Loan status summary (Current, Fully Paid, Charged Off)

# Performed breakdowns by:

. State, Term, Purpose, Employee Length, Home Ownership

. Monthly loan trends

. Added grade-level and purpose-level KPI analysis for deeper insights.

# 2️⃣ Python Data Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)

. Cleaned and transformed loan data using Pandas

. Handled missing values & data type corrections

# Created visualizations:

. Bar charts (Loan purpose, State-wise loans, Employee length)

. Pie charts (Loan status, Term distribution)

. Heatmaps (Correlation matrix)

. Line charts (Monthly trends)

# Conducted exploratory analysis to understand:

. Funding patterns

. Customer financial profile

. High-risk vs low-risk loan behavior

# 3️⃣ Power BI Interactive Dashboard

# Created 3 fully dynamic dashboards:

# 📌 Summary Dashboard

# Overall KPIs:

**Total Loan Applications:** 38.6K

**Total Funded Amount:** 435.8M

**Total Amount Received:** 473.1M

 **Avg Interest Rate:** 12.05% 

 **Avg DTI:** 13.33%

# Good vs Bad Loan Segmentation

# Loan status performance matrix

Key financial insights

# 📌 Overview Dashboard

# Monthly loan trends

# Loan distribution by:

. State

. Term

. Employee length

. Purpose

. Home ownership

. Integrated slicers for dynamic filtering

# 📌 Details Dashboard

Record-level loan dataset

# Searchable and filterable by:

. Grade

. State

. Purpose

Shows complete loan journey with all financial fields

# 4️⃣ Excel Dashboard

Built a structured dashboard using Pivot Tables & Charts:

. Loan applications by purpose, term, home ownership

. State-wise & monthly summary

. Good vs Bad loan KPI comparison

. Added slicers for interactive filtering

. Provided tabular summary for audit and reporting needs

# 📈 Key Insights Delivered

. **86%** of loans are Good Loans (Fully Paid + Current)

. **13.8%** of loans are Bad Loans (Charged Off)

. **Highest** loan applications occur in December & November

. **Most common loan purpose:** Debt Consolidation

. **Majority borrowers** have 10+ years of experience

. **Most loans** are 36-month term loans (73%)

# 🎯 Project Outcome

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills — from data extraction (SQL) → data preprocessing (Python) → interactive visualization (Power BI & Excel).

# It provides a complete Bank Loan Performance Monitoring System, enabling organizations to:

. Track financial KPIs

. Understand borrower behavior

. Identify risk categories

. Improve loan approval strategies
