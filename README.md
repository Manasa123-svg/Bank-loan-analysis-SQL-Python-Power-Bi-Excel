# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Bank Loan data to evaluate loan performance, customer behavior, risk segmentation, and key financial KPIs. Using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, I built a complete data analysis and visualization solution that supports data-driven decision-making for loan approvals, collections, and portfolio health monitoring.

# 🔧 Tools & Technologies

**SQL:** Database creation, KPI calculations, monthly trends, segmentation

**Python:** Data cleaning, transformation, EDA, visualization

**Power BI:** Summary, Overview, and Detailed dashboards

**Excel:**  Pivot analysis, charts, slicers, summary dashboards

# Overall KPIs:

**Total Loan Applications:** 38.6K

**Total Funded Amount:** 435.8M

**Total Amount Received:** 473.1M

 **Avg Interest Rate:** 12.05% 

 **Avg DTI:** 13.33%

# 📊 Project Deliverables
